#Hii all This is DAY87(30-01-2024) Today's Topic's is Python â€“ Records with Value at K index

# Python3 code to demonstrate working of
# Records with Value at K index
# Using loop
# initialize list 
test_list = [(3, 1, 5), (1, 3, 6), (2, 5, 7), (5, 2, 8), (6, 3, 0)]
# printing original list
print("The original list is : " + str(test_list))
# initialize ele 
ele = 3
# initialize K 
K = 1
# Records with Value at K index
# Using loop
# using y for K = 1 
res = []
for x, y, z in test_list:
	if y == ele:
		res.append((x, y, z))
# printing result
print("The tuples of element at Kth position : " + str(res))
